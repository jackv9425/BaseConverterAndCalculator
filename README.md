# BaseConverterAndCalculator
This programm does not work without the command line. The JAR file is pointless because of this, but this was a school project and making an executable JAR file was required.

The first thing you will see in this programm is a message:
"What Would You Like To Do?"
There are two valid inputs after this: "Calculate" and "Base Conversion"
Each of these options are self-explanatory.

When inputing expressions to be calculated, separate numbers and operators with spaces as shown below:
86 * B9 - s2 =

The programm works for bases 2 to 62, with numbers first, then uppercase letters, then lowercase letters.
